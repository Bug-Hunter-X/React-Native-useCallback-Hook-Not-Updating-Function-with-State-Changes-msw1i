This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that uses a value from the component's state. If the state value changes, the function returned by `useCallback` is not updated, resulting in unexpected behavior.

For example:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // Incorrect: Missing count dependency

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
In this example, the `increment` function uses the `setCount` function, which relies on the `count` value. However, the `useCallback` hook has an empty dependency array `[]`, meaning it won't update the function when `count` changes. This will cause the `increment` function to always use the initial value of `count`, resulting in the counter not working correctly.
