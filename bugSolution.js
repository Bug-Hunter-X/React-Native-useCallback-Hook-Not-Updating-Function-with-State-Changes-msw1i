The solution is to include the state value in the dependency array of the `useCallback` hook. This ensures that the function is re-created whenever the state value changes.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, [count]); // Correct: Includes count dependency

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
By including `count` in the dependency array, the `increment` function is now correctly recreated whenever the `count` state variable changes, ensuring that the counter functionality is accurate.
